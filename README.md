# MSc Dissertation Project ‚Äì Detecting Illicit Accounts on Ethereum Blockchain using Machine Learning

This repository contains the source code and supporting material for my MSc dissertation project at Manchester Metropolitan University (2024‚Äì2025).  
The project investigates machine learning algorithms to identify illicit accounts on the Ethereum blockchain, contributing to enhanced trust and anomaly detection in decentralized systems.
